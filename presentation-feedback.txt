introduce arm cavity WITHIN cavity
slide 4 bh and ns locations also math strain delta L/l
slide 5 graphical show imposing
slide 6 remove math, also show bw of wlc
Slide 9 acknowledge hgih q came from EQUS

timeline - this is scope and timeline combined call it proposed work
ultimate goal is just to measure interaction
if time allows, cryogenics, 
move rad pressure to before cryogenics
simulate q-factor degradation

how much is a good coupling

slide 7 not nessceary, jsut say we can realize through OM interaction
slide 8 reduce the time spent on this
