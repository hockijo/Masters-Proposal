          , 
            To date, microscale and nanoscale optomechanical systems have enabled many proof-of-principle quantum operations through access to high-frequency (gigahertz) phonon modes that are readily cooled to their thermal ground state. However, minuscule amounts of absorbed light produce excessive heating that can jeopardize robust ground-state operation within these microstructures. In contrast, we demonstrate an alternative strategy for accessing high-frequency (13 GHz) phonons within macroscopic systems (centimeter scale) using phase-matched Brillouin interactions between two distinct optical cavity modes. Counterintuitively, we show that these macroscopic systems, with motional masses that are 1 million to 100 million times larger than those of microscale counterparts, offer a complementary path toward robust ground-state operation. We perform both optomechanically induced amplification/transparency measurements and demonstrate parametric instability of bulk phonon modes. This is an important step toward using these beam splitter and two-mode squeezing interactions within bulk acoustic systems for applications ranging from quantum memories and microwave-to-optical conversion to high-power laser oscillators.},

	abstract = {Closed-form asymptotic expressions for the frequency-wavenumber dispersion relations in doubly rotated quartz plates vibrating in the vicinity of the odd pure thickness frequencies are derived from the equations of linear piezoelectricity and the associated boundary conditions on the major surfaces. The usual assumptions of small piezoelectric coupling and small wavenumbers along the plate are made and it is supposed that the pure thickness frequencies are sufficiently different that one pure thickness wave is dominant at a time. In the treatment the mechanical displacement is decomposed along the eigenvector triad of the pure thickness solution to facilitate the asymptotic analysis. The fact that the wavenumbers along the plate are restricted to be small significantly reduces the complexity of the equations without neglecting any transformed elastic constants. The resulting asymptotic dispersion equation enables the construction of a scalar differential equation describing the transverse behavior of essentially thickness modes of vibration in doubly rotated quartz plates. The scalar equation is applied in the analysis of both trapped energy resonators with rectangular electrodes and contoured crystal resonators using established procedures. In particular, calculations performed for the contoured SC cut and a number of other doubly rotated orientations are shown to be in excellent agreement with experiment. Since the differential equation for each harmonic family depends on the order of the harmonic and in the general doubly rotated case contains mixed derivatives in the plane of the plate, a different transformation is required for each harmonic family to obtain the coordinate system in which the mixed derivatives do not appear and, hence, the equation is separable. An interesting consequence of this transformation is that since the nodal planes of the anharmonics of each harmonic family of the contoured SC-cut quartz resonator are oriented along the transformed coordinate system for that harmonic family, they are oriented differently for each harmonic family. © 1986, Acoustical Society of America.

In this scheme, the optomechanical coupling Hamiltonian can be expressed in a linearised form using the rotating wave approximation in the interaction picture, resulting in equation 1 of the main text.

The curved cavity system resolves the quandary of the conventional mechanical system where the Bose-Einstein distribution requires higher frequencies for lower quantum occupation factors contrary to the constraint of an inverse frequency dependence of the quantum fluctuations of displacement. We demonstrate how the non-trivial cavity geometry can lead to better phonon trapping, enhancing the variance of zero-point-fluctuations of displacement. This variance becomes independent of overtone (OT) number (or BAW resonance frequency) overcoming the constraint and allowing better observation of quantum effects in a mechanical system. The piezoelectric electro-mechanical coupling approach is qualitatively compared to the parametric optomechanical technique for the curved BAW cavities. In both cases the detectible quantity grows proportional to the square root of the OT number, and thus the resonance frequency. Also, the phonon trapping improves with higher OT numbers, which allows the electrode size to be reduced such that in the optimal case the parasitic capacitive impedance becomes independent of the OT number, allowing effective coupling to very high frequency OTs. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.},

Here we show demonstrated optomechanical resonators that meet loss requirements for a white light signal recycling interferometer with strain sensitivity below 10−24 Hz−1/2 at a few kHz. Experimental data for two resonators are combined with analytic models of interferometers similar to LIGO to demonstrate enhancement across a broader band of frequencies versus dual-recycled Fabry-Perot Michelson detectors. Candidate resonators are a silicon nitride membrane acoustically isolated by a phononic crystal, and a single-crystal quartz acoustic cavity.

Optomechanical systems based on bulk acoustic-wave resonators are well suited for this goal in light of their high quality factors, and because they do not suffer from surface interactions as much as their microscale counterparts. However, so far these phonons have been accessible only electromechanically, using piezoelectric interactions. Here, we demonstrate customizable optomechanical coupling to macroscopic phonon modes of a bulk acoustic-wave resonator at cryogenic temperatures. These phonon modes, which are formed by shaping the surfaces of a crystal into a plano-convex phononic resonator, yield appreciable optomechanical coupling rates, providing access to high acoustic quality factors (4.2 × 10 7 ) at high phonon frequencies (13 GHz). This simple approach, which uses bulk properties rather than nanostructural control, is appealing for the ability to engineer optomechanical systems at high frequencies that are robust against thermal decoherence. Moreover, we show that this optomechanical system yields a unique form of dispersive symmetry-breaking that enables phonon heating or cooling without an optical cavity.},

Because of positive dispersion of these cavities—signals at different frequencies pick up different phases, there is a tradeoff between the detector bandwidth and peak sensitivity, which is a universal feature for quantum measurement devices having resonant cavities. We consider embedding an active unstable filter inside the interferometer to compensate the phase, and using feedback control to stabilize the entire system. We show that this scheme in principle can enhance the bandwidth without sacrificing the peak sensitivity. However, the unstable filter under our current consideration is a cavity-assisted optomechanical device operating in the instability regime, and the thermal fluctuation of the mechanical oscillator puts a very stringent requirement on the environmental temperature and the mechanical quality factor.},

The nature of standard Fabry–Perot cavities is such that one cannot independently adjust for increased gain without suffering a loss of bandwidth. If these quantities could be decoupled, the resulting improvement in bandwidth may lead to viable high frequency detectors.

	abstract = {Previously, we had proposed a gravitational wave detector that incorporates the white-light-cavity (WLC) effect using a compound cavity for signal recycling (CC-SR). Here, we first use an idealized model for the negative dispersion medium (NDM) and use the so-called Caves model for a phase-insensitive linear amplifier to account for the quantum noise (QN) contributed by the NDM, in order to determine the upper bound of the enhancement in the sensitivity-bandwidth product. We calculate the quantum noise limited sensitivity curves for the CC-SR design, and find that the broadening of sensitivity predicted by the classical analysis is also present in these curves, but is somewhat reduced. Furthermore, we find that the curves always stay above the standard quantum limit. To circumvent this limitation, we modify the dispersion to compensate the nonlinear phase variation produced by the optomechanical resonance effects. We find that the upper bound of the factor by which the sensitivity-bandwidth product is increased, compared to the highest-sensitivity result predicted by Bunanno and Chen [Phys. Rev. D 64, 042006 (2001)], is ∼14. We also present a simpler scheme (WLC-SR), where a dispersion medium is inserted into the SR cavity. For this scheme, we found the upper bound of the enhancement factor to be ∼18. We then consider an explicit system for realizing the NDM, which makes use of five energy levels in M configuration to produce gain, accompanied by electromagnetically induced transparency (the GEIT system). For this explicit system, we employ the rigorous approach based on Master Equation to compute the QN contributed by the NDM, thus enabling us to determine the enhancement in the sensitivity-bandwidth product definitively rather than the upper bound thereof. Specifically, we identify a set of parameters for which the sensitivity-bandwidth product is enhanced by a factor of 17.66.},

Commun. 34, 431 (1997)], is to circumvent this limitation by introducing anomalous dispersion, using a double-pumped gain medium, to compensate for such a phase delay. In this article, starting from the Hamiltonian of the atom-light interaction, we apply an input-output formalism to evaluate the quantum noise of the system. We find that apart from the additional noise associated with the parametric amplification process noted by others, the stability condition for the entire system poses an additional constraint. By surveying the parameter regimes where the gain medium remains stable (not lasing) and stationary, we find that there is no net enhancement of the shot-noise-limited sensitivity. Therefore, other gain media or different parameter regimes should be explored for realizing the white-light cavity.},

We review the phenomenology of late merger/post-merger GW emission in BNS coalescence and demonstrate how an understanding of the dynamics during and after the merger leads to the construction of a universal spectrum. We also provide a discussion of the prospects for detecting the post-merger signal in future GW detectors as a potential contribution to the science case for third generation instruments. The template derived in our analysis achieves match across a wide variety of merger waveforms and strain sensitivity spectra for current and potential GW detectors.

	abstract = {Current and future interferometeric gravitational-wave detectors are limited predominantly by shot noise at high frequencies. Shot noise is reduced by introducing arm cavities and signal recycling, however, there exists a trade-off between the peak sensitivity and bandwidth. This comes from the accumulated phase of signal sidebands when propagating inside the arm cavities. One idea is to cancel such a phase by introducing an unstable optomechanical filter. The original design proposed in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 211104 (2015)] requires an additional optomechanical filter coupled externally to the main interferometer. Here we consider a simplified design that converts the signal-recycling cavity itself into the unstable filter by using one mirror as a high-frequency mechanical oscillator and introducing an additional pump laser. However, the enhancement in bandwidth of this new design is less than the original design given the same set of optical parameters. The peak sensitivity improvement factor depends on the arm length, the signal-recycling cavity length, and the final detector bandwidth. For a 4 km interferometer, if the final detector bandwidth is around 2 kHz, with a 20 m signal-recycling cavity, the shot noise can be reduced by 10 decibels, in addition to the improvement introduced by squeezed light injection. We also find that the thermal noise of the mechanical oscillator is amplified at low frequencies relative to the vacuum noise, while having a flat spectrum at high frequencies.},

	abstract = {Coherent interaction of laser radiation with multilevel atoms and molecules can lead to quantum interference in the electronic excitation pathways. A prominent example observed in atomic three-level-systems is the phenomenon of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), in which a control laser induces a narrow spectral transparency window for a weak probe laser beam. The concomitant rapid variation of the refractive index in this spectral window can give rise to dramatic reduction of the group velocity of a propagating pulse of probe light. Dynamic control of EIT via the control laser enables even a complete stop, that is, storage, of probe light pulses in the atomic medium. Here, we demonstrate optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT)--formally equivalent to EIT--in a cavity optomechanical system operating in the resolved sideband regime. A control laser tuned to the lower motional sideband of the cavity resonance induces a dipole-like interaction of optical and mechanical degrees of freedom. Under these conditions, the destructive interference of excitation pathways for an intracavity probe field gives rise to a window of transparency when a two-photon resonance condition is met. As a salient feature of EIT, the power of the control laser determines the width and depth of the probe transparency window. OMIT could therefore provide a new approach for delaying, slowing and storing light pulses in long-lived mechanical excitations of optomechanical systems, whose optical and mechanical properties can be tailored in almost arbitrary ways in the micro- and nano-optomechanical platforms developed to date.},

	abstract = {A new method of probing mechanical losses and comparing the corresponding deposition processes of metallic and dielectric coatings in 1-100 MHz frequency range and cryogenic temperatures is presented. The method is based on the use of high-quality quartz acoustic cavities whose internal losses are orders of magnitude lower than any available coating nowadays. The approach is demonstrated for chromium, chromium/gold, and multilayer tantala/silica coatings. The Ta2O5/SiO2 coating has been found to exhibit a loss angle lower than 1.6 × 10−5 near 30 MHz at 4 K. The results are compared to the previous measurements.},

	abstract = {Detections of gravitational waves (GW) in the frequency band 35 to 500 Hz have led to the birth of GW astronomy. Expected signals above 500 Hz, such as the quasinormal modes of lower mass black holes and neutron star merger signatures, are currently not detectable due to increasing quantum shot noise at high frequencies. Squeezed vacuum injection has been shown to allow broadband sensitivity improvement, but this technique does not change the slope of the noise at high frequency. It has been shown that white light signal recycling using negative dispersion optomechanical filter cavities with strong optical dilution for thermal noise suppression can in principle allow broadband high frequency sensitivity improvement. Here we present detailed modeling of AlGaAs/GaAs optomechanical filters to identify the available parameter space in which such filters can achieve the low thermal noise required to allow useful sensitivity improvement at high frequency. Material losses, the resolved sideband condition and internal acoustic modes dictate the need for resonators substantially smaller than previously suggested. We identify suitable resonator dimensions and show that a 30 μm scale cat-flap resonator combined with optical squeezing allows 8 fold improvement of strain sensitivity at 2 kHz compared with Advanced LIGO. This corresponds to a detection volume increase of a factor of 500 for sources in this frequency range.},

	abstract = {The only evidence we have for a discrete reality comes from quantum measurements; without invoking these measurements, quantum theory describes continuous entities. This seeming contradiction can be resolved via analysis that treats measurements as boundary constraints. It is well-known that boundaries can induce apparently-discrete behavior in continuous systems, and strong analogies can be drawn to the case of quantum measurement. If quantum discreteness arises in this manner, this would not only indicate an analog reality, but would also offer a solution to the so-called "measurement problem".},
